# Topic: 
   Ozone layer/ Ozone pollution or related gas analyze.

# Hypothesis 1:  
- Data Used:      
    - metdata_year.csv in ozone folder which contains the precipitation and ozone data for all the sites in united states.    
    - Site.csv : pair each SITE_ID to which State it actually in.     
    - water_cover.csv : each States' water coverage rate in United States.
- The rain fall will reduce the ozone pollution in the air  
    (People always feel the air is more fresh and clean after raining. So is that means when it is raining, the water will have some chemical reaction with the ozone pollution. If this is true, it means after raining, the ozone pollution amount will smaller.)       

    We calculate the 5 hours average ozone pollution before each raining, and also the 5 hours average ozone pollution after each time of raining.
    Then we calculate the rate which the times that pollution is getting lower divided by the total times of raining.
    Below are the 10 example result by the SiteID in alphabetical order.

    As a overview for all United States in year 2010-2019:    
    we have the highest rate: 0.6363636363636364 and the lowest rate: 0.47619047619047616

    Through the data above, we can see that only 1 year has less than 50% of the better SITE.     
   
    ---- Conclusion ----    
    The rain fall (PRECIPITATION) has significant influence on the ozone pollution. The recent 10 years data shows that around 60% of the site's pollution each year will be optimized by the rain.    
- With more water coverage, a state can reduce more ozone pollution      
    (From the previous analyze, we found that water does influence the ozone pollution. So after analyzed the water from rain fall, we want to focus on the other side: the water in the lake or river.   
     We want to see if the water coverage of each state affect to the ozone pollution.)
     
    Below is plot shows the relationship between the state water coverage with the average ozone pollution.    
    The x-axis is the percentage of the state water coverage rate, the y-axis is the mean ozone pollution for that state. And each line represent a single year. So the plot show the recent 10 years, each state's water coverage with the mean ozone pollution.   
    ![diagram](result/hypotheses1/watercover_ozone.png)   
    From the plot, we can see that the coverage of the 0-10% has huge difference in each states so that the lines are tend to be more bounce.
    The coverage rate 10-20% is much more flat. And the lines going aggregation at the end. Of course since there are not too much states have the water coverage rate in 30-40%, it is not a significant value to give the conclusion that the line are going aggregation. However, we have a significant amount of states are in the 10-20% range. From this part
    we can prove that with the higher water coverage, the ozone pollutions are tend to be more flat curve and they aggregated to a certain range. 
    
    Further more, we also analyzed the ozone pollution growth rate. Consider about how CO2's circulation in the earth, water is an important part to do the chemical reaction and a buffer. So if our assumption is correct, as how CO2 circulation, the ozone pollution should have less changing rate in the area with more water coverage.   
    ![diagram](result/hypotheses1/watercover_growRate.png)    
    This plot shows the relationship between the water coverage and the growth rate of the ozone pollution in recent 10 years. (x-axis: the water coverage, y-axis: recent 10 years average ozone growth rate)       
    From the plot we can indicate that same as the previous analyze, the more water a state has, it has a more constant growth rate. 0-5% water coverage part have a really bouncy line which we believe that since there is too little water to reaction with ozone-pollution and has almost no buffer to the rapidly increasing ozone pollution. 
    And the area with 5% - 20% are tend to be converge in growth rate -10% - 0%. Such analyze proved that our previous assumption is correct.     
    ---- Conclusion ----    
    The water act as a buffer in the ozone circulation, so with the higher water coverage, the ozone pollution's mean are tend to be more converge. And if a state has a higher water coverage, its ozone pollution's growth rate is less likely to change either.
     
    
# Hypothesis 2:     
- Data used:
    - metdata file for ozone pollution recent 10 years
    - data file for the recent volcanoes eruption information
    - metdata file for other pollution gas in recent 10 years
    
- Will the volcanoes eruption influence the ozone pollution?    
    (As most of the environment department discover, one of the factor influence the ozone layer is the volcanoes' eruption. So we want to analyze that when the volcano erupted, how does the ozone pollution change. )     
     - Difficulties:     
      Since the ozone data is not really high quality which means we missed some data, especially the Hawaii. The Hawaii's volcano was erupted 3 times in 2018, by there are no ozone data collected in Hawaii during that year. 
     So instead of trying to analyze its own State data, we collected nearest 5 sites to where the volcanoes are. 
     Then select all usable data to do the further analyze.     
     - Analyze:     
     After sort the 5 nearest sites, we plot the time period from 48h before the eruption to 132h after the eruption.      
     Notice that, since these site are all 2000 miles away from the volcano, so these measurements are likely to be affect by lots of reason. For example, the volcanoes did not explore that much pollutions or the pollutions did not travel that much.
     In this report, we will just show some significant results, and others full result plots are in the result_graph/volcano folder.
     - Results:    
     (All these plots is the relationships between the time and the ozone pollution amount. x-axis: 48 hours before erupted to 132 hours after erupted.
     y-axis: the ozone pollution amount. Labels: each site's Site_ID and how many miles its away from the volcano)
     ![diagram](result/hypotheses2/2010-05-29.png)
     This plot clearly shows that the site: DEN417 which is 3856 miles from the volcano 'Sarigan' has a huge ozone pollution growth after 75 hours of eruption.
     ![diagram](result/hypotheses2/2012-03-02.png)
     Above is the 'Kilauea' which erupted in 2012-03-02. As we can see that the LAV410 appeared same rapidly growth after 100 hours of the eruption.
     But others nearest site did not have a significant change during this time. So we believed that this is affected by the wind blow direction. Such means that after the volcano erupted, the wind blow the pollution to one specific direction so not all near by sites got influenced by the volcano.
     ![diagram](result/hypotheses2/2014-11-10.png)     
     (Another significant example)      
     ---- Conclusion ----
     The volcanoes eruption will increase the ozone pollution rapidly and influenced the surrounded area.

# Hypothesis 3:
- We may expect a seasonal trend over all states regarding to ozone mean in total from Year 2015 - Year 2019
  
  In order to get ozone mean of each month calculated, we need to transfer the "DATE_TIME" column from object type to datatime type and match "DATE_TIME" column with corresponding month via creating new column "MONTH". Since there are multiple Sites with corresponding "SITE_ID" for each site in the each of the 50 states, we need to match the STATE with each of the "SITE_ID". After that, we group by both "STATE" and "MONTH" in order to get the ozone mean for each state in each month. In order to get the overall ozone mean within five years for each month, we group by "MONTH" and then merge dataframes to get the ozone mean corresponding with each month in total via concat.
  
  Here is the statistical result for ozone mean in total corresponding with each month:
  ![diagram](result/hypothesis3/overall_stats_result.png) 
  
  Here are the boxplots for month versus ozone mean in all states for each year respectively:
  ![diagram](result/hypothesis3/boxplot_2015.png)
  ![diagram](result/hypothesis3/boxplot_2016.png)
  ![diagram](result/hypothesis3/boxplot_2017.png)
  ![diagram](result/hypothesis3/boxplot_2018.png)
  ![diagram](result/hypothesis3/boxplot_2019.png)
  
  From boxplots above, we can see that there exists an ascending trend from January to April with corresponding ozone mean and an descending trend from April to December in each year from 2015 to 2019. As for year 2019, though it's not exactly the ascending trend from January to April(more likely from January to March), it follows a pattern of ascending firstly and then descending through out the rest of the months. Therefore, it's reasonable for us to infer the trend for each month with corresponding ozone mean in total from Year 2015 to Year 2019 to be the same.
  
  Here is the bar chart for ozone mean in total from Year 2015 - Year 2019 with each month respectively:
  ![diagram](result/hypothesis3/months_ozone_total.png)
  From the plot above, the statistical result shows that there exists a trend such that ascending from January to April and descending from April December regarding to Ozone mean in total. This match the boxplot trend for each month corresponding with Ozone mean for each year range from 2015 - 2019.
  
  ---- Conclusion ---- 
  The seasonable trend over all states regarding to ozone mean in totoal from Year 2015 - Year 2019 is to ascend from Januanry to April and to descend from April to December.

    - Site.csv : pair each SITE_ID to which State it actually in.   


# Hypothesis 4:
- We expect a trend over regions within five years and we expect certain specific pattern over regions while comparing each year

  We calcualte the mean of Ozone for each state from Year 2015 to Year 2019 respectively and convert to dataframe as a whole. Then, we match each of the states to each region through of all 50 states in the United States. The Regions and divisions of the United States are defined as West, Midwest, Northeast and South which are four regions in total. After that, we group by each region regarding to the average of the region'ozone. Regarding to the ozone mean in total from Year 2015 to Year 2019, based on the ozone mean with each of the region from each year respecitvely, then we sum up 5 years ozone mean as a whole and divide within 5 years to get the ozone mean in total statistics.
  
  Here is the overview for ozone mean in each region from each year and ozone mean in total within five years:
  ![diagram](result/hypothesis4/statistical-result.png)
  
  Here is the plot for multiple year comparison between region and ozone mean each year respectively:
  ![diagram](result/hypothesis4/multiple_year_comparison.png)
  From the plot above, we can see how ozone mean of each region compare to that of other regions in each year. We can also tell that there exists a trend such that ozone mean of Year 2016 and ozone mean of Year 2018 are higher than that of other years in each of the four different regions within five years. 
  
  Here is the plot for ozone mean in total comparison within four regions from Year 2015 - Year 2019:
  ![diagram](result/hypothesis4/Totalregioncompare.png)
  From the plot above, we can see that Midwest region has the highest overall ozone mean compare to that of other regions and West region has the lowest overall ozone mean within five years in total. The overall ozone mean within five years in descending order is ranked by Midwest, Northeast, South and West.
  
  ---- Conclusion ----   
  In the perspective of comparing ozone mean of four regions each year respectively, the statistical result tells us that there exists a pattern such that ozone mean of 2016 and ozone mean of 2018 are higher than that of other years in each of the region. In the perspective of comparing ozone mean in total of regions, the statistical result tells that there exists a trend in descending order regarding to ozone mean in total in five years: Midwest > Northeast > South > West.
