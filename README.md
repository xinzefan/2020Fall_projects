Assumption 1 :   
- Dose the rain falls influence the ozone pollution?     

    We calculate the 5 hours average ozone pollution before each raining, and also the 5 hours average ozone pollution after each time of raining.
    Then we calculate the rate which the times that pollution is getting lower divided by the total times of raining.
    Below are the 10 example result by the SiteID in alphabetical order.

    As a overview for all United States in year 2010-2019:    
    we have the highest rate: 0.6363636363636364 and the lowest rate: 0.47619047619047616

    2019: 0.6363636363636364     
    Through the data above, we can see that only 1 year has less than 50% of the better SITE.     
    ---- Conclusion ----    
    The rain fall (PRECIPITATION) has siginificantly 
- How is the water coverage influence the ozone pollution? 


# Assumption 2:
Assumption2:     
Will the volcanos erruption influence the ozone polution?
How about other pollution gas changing? 
# Assumption 3:
How recently 5 years(from 2015-2019) ozone mean compare in each of the state in the perspective of each months(From Jan to December)?


# Assumption 4:
How ozone mean in recently 5 years(from 2015-2019) compare in 4 different regions which are Midwest, Northeast, South and west?
In details, conclude the variation in all states in 4 different regions.
any state did not follow the trends in any region for each year?
